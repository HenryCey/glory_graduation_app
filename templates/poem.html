        <p class="poem-line">You wear a smile, though the world may not see,</p>
        <p class="poem-line">The depth of your kindness, your quiet beauty.</p>
        <p class="poem-line">Gentle and funny, yet stronger than most,</p>
        <p class="poem-line">Your light shines brightest when life tries to boast.</p>

        <p class="poem-line">Though shy at first, your soul is wide,</p>
        <p class="poem-line">A place where laughter and care reside.</p>
        <p class="poem-line">Not all can know the treasure you are,</p>
        <p class="poem-line">But God does — and He’s brought you far.</p>

        <p class="poem-line">So here’s to the journey, the healing, the cheer,</p>
        <p class="poem-line">To brighter tomorrows, to love without fear.</p>
        <p class="poem-line">You’re more than the pain, more than the past,</p>
        <p class="poem-line">You’re a friend worth keeping, a joy that will last.</p>
        <p class="poem-line">Continue winning and shine on my dear friend {Glory Ejiogu}</p>
